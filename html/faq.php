                                                  significance are almost always those that are the simplest. While
                                                  “Ordinal” may be the most logical for some, “Reduction” is frequently
                                                  referred to as the purest form of numerology.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>Ancient Hebrew and Greek utilized a different format, however, assigning
                                                  their letters the values 1-9, 10-100, and 100-900. This progression is
                                                  called “Standard” Gematriaverse and is labeled as such on the calculator.
                                                  The “Latin” method uses the same chart, but honors the order of the
                                                  Latin alphabet. These ciphers are certainly just as important as the
                                                  “base four” seen when opening the calculator.</p>

                                                  gematria’s relevance, more insight can often be provided through
                                                  additional methods. The ones featured on this site are typically based
                                                  on simple mathematical concepts (Prime numbers, Triangulars, Squares,
                                                  etc.) that were also observed in older languages. “Sumerian” gematria
                                                  multiplies the alphabet by 6, the upside-down 9 that our knowledge of
                                                  time is based off of. “Satanic” Gematriaverse is an occult method that
                                                  begins on 36 because the 36th Triangular number is 666. “Satanic
                                                  gematria” = 666 in that very cipher.</p>
                                             <p>While there are certainly other ciphers in existence not featured, it is

                                                  that does not mean they don’t have their place. There are good

                                             <p>In my observations, significant numerical alignments will be the
                                                  strongest for our births, deaths, and major life events. This could
                                                  include a marriage, the purchase of a house, or the start of a dream
                                                  job, but also suffering an injury, having something stolen, or getting
                                                  in an accident. All of these things shape the direction of our lives,
                                                  and can determine where we will be spending significant amounts of
                                                  time.</p>
                                             <p>In my experience, I have little question that synchronicity itself is
                                                  also coded. Ever have something happen that seemed so incredibly
                                                  unlikely, there just HAD to be something more to it? The names and
                                                  ages of the people and/or symbols involved are likely to have strong
                                                  connections with you and the event’s date.</p>
                                             <p>Many, many other things have evidence of being coded and connected.
                                                  Significant achievements in sports, film and television release dates,
                                                  the beginning and end of wars…all the way down to individual news
                                                  stories and other things in media every day. There’s even evidence of
                                                  patterns related to Gematriaverse in the stock market, in cryptocurrency,
                                                  and more.</p>
                                             <p>How useful is knowing more about numerology in investing or other
                                                  markets of risk, like gambling? It can give you a bigger piece of the
                                                  larger picture, and may even increase probability in your favor. Very
                                                  few would be wise, however, to use what most consider a pseudoscience
                                                  to direct their resources without having a lot of meaningful (even
                                                  revelatory) experiences on their own. Like any language, it takes time
                                                  to understand, and those who claim to have all the answers are the
                                                  likeliest to still be seeking some.</p>

                                             <p>I believe that our world is a divine creation whose purpose is to
                                                  provide us with a series of experiences and relationships that teach
                                                  us more about ourselves. It reveals our true connectedness with others
                                                  to those who better the lives of themselves and those around them by
                                                  working hard and spreading love and kindness.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>I had always held a generic belief in God since I was young, and this
                                                  was re-affirmed to me with a powerful experience I had in the summer
                                                  of 2001. However, it wasn’t until I began observing the world through
                                                  the perspective I’m now sharing that my overly-analytical mind could
                                                  no longer ignore the evidence that someone (or something) far more
                                                  intelligent than us is at work.</p>
                                             <p>This creator or entity is not as concerned with our emotions as we’d
                                                  like for it to be. Unfortunately, not all the lessons we learn are
                                                  fun, and things like failure and tragedy are something many of us have
                                                  to go through to earn this growth. But it does appear these types of
                                                  things happen at junctions in our life that may be preestablished in
                                                  some sense.</p>
